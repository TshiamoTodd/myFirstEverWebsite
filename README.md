# myFirstEverWebsite
This is the first ever website I created in 2014 with purely HTML and CSS only, it was my first attempt at programming a website, It is however very unprofessional but oh well I guess we all had to start somewhere. 

To prove that I was still an amature when I created this website, it has HTML and CSS embeded into one file. Those were the good old days, HAHAHAHAH.
